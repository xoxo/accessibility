# Accessibility

**This is a living policy, subject to continual refinement and expansion. Last updated May 26, 2024**.

Itâ€™s important to us that XOXO reflects the diverse and vibrant creative communities it was created to celebrate. We currently make the following accommodations in our production for attendees who require accessibility considerations.

If you have questions about this policy, or suggestions for ways it might be improved, please contact us at [hi@xoxofest.com](mailto:hi@xoxofest.com). 

## Accessibility

XOXO primarily takes place at Revolution Hall, a 850-capacity theater and music venue located inside Washington High. Both Revolution Hall and Washington High were completely renovated and reopened in 2014, and are in line with modern building accessibility code and ADA guidelines. 

The main venue floor has clearly marked hallways and aisles (at least 3.5ft wide), elevators, ramps, accessible restrooms, and wayfinding that highlights accessible routes. We also provide reserved seating areas inside Revolution Hall for attendees with mobility devices and/or mobility issues.

We also use Washington High Park, a field adjacent to Washington High, as a secondary venue and social space. We construct a staircase and accessible ramp for entry into the park, and lay outdoor flooring tiles to provide access to the Park Stage, bar, and outdoor seating areas for attendees who use mobility devices.

## Live Captioning

Our main stage programming is accompanied by real-time captioning. We provide reserved seating for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing directly in front of the captioning screens.

## Service Animals

Service animals are welcome at XOXO.
